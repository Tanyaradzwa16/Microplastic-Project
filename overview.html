        <h2>Welcome to the Microplastics Project</h2>
        <p>Microplastics are tiny plastic fragments that enter our environment through pollution and waste. They are now found everywhere, including our food and water, with unknown long-term health impacts on humans and biodiversity. This project examines these issues to better understand microplastics' sources, contamination in foods, and their impact on the ecosystem.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Microplastics Matter</h3>
        <p>Microplastics can disrupt marine and terrestrial environments, leading to severe consequences for species survival and ecological balance. We aim to explore ways to limit microplastic contamination and raise awareness of its dangers.</p>

        <div id="extraContent" style="display: none;">
            <p>Our work is centered on research collaboration, data analysis, and public awareness. We work with scientists, environmentalists, and policymakers to address microplastic pollution and its far-reaching impacts.</p>
