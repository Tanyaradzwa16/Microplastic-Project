        <h2>Understanding Microplastics</h2>
        <p>Microplastics are particles smaller than 5 mm that come from a range of sources, including plastic waste, industrial processes, and consumer products. Over time, they break down and spread into our water, soil, and even air.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Microplastics</h3>
        <p>Microplastics are categorized into two types: primary and secondary. Primary microplastics are small particles manufactured for industrial purposes, while secondary microplastics result from the breakdown of larger plastics.</p>
        
        <h3>Impact on Human Health and Environment</h3>
        <p>Microplastics have been found in human tissues, raising concerns about their effects on health. Their presence disrupts ecosystems, especially aquatic habitats, by harming marine life, contaminating food chains, and disturbing biodiversity.</p>
